## Usage

This example project uses *598cd5656c78fc13c4d7c274ac41f34737e6b4d0e86af5c3ab47c81674dde666* as the token to pass to the hosting service. If you change the service token, this should also be changed.

```c# 
      using var managedClient =
        new GrpcClientManaged(new GrpcClientManagedOptions(" https://localhost:5001", Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
            {
                AuthBearerToken = "598cd5656c78fc13c4d7c274ac41f34737e6b4d0e86af5c3ab47c81674dde666",
                UseDefaultAuthorization = true
            }
            ,logger);
```
