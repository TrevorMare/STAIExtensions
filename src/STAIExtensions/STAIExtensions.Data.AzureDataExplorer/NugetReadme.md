## STAIExtensions Data AzureDataExplorer

### Overview
This library is included to enable Application Insights to be read via the Azure Data Explorer Api.
In most cases this should be sufficient for building the basic views emitted to the users. This package exposes abstract queries
that can be implemented and load custom Kusto query data from the source. By default
it is able to populate all the models found in Application Insights at this point in time.
